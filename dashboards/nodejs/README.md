# Node.js automated dashboards

There are two automated dashboards for the Node.js programming language:

- [Heap Statistics](#heap-statistics-automated-dashboard)
- [Postgres](#postgres-automated-dashboard-deprecated) (deprecated)

## Heap statistics automated dashboard

TO-DO: write this

## Postgres automated dashboard (deprecated)

As of version 3.x of the AppSignal for Node.js integration, the metrics used on the Postgres automated dashboard are no longer emitted, and therefore this automated dashboard is no longer created.
