# Node.js magic dashboards

There are two magic dashboards for the Node.js programming language:

- [Heap Statistics](#heap-statistics-magic-dashboard)
- [Postgres](#postgres-magic-dashboard-deprecated) (deprecated)

## Heap statistics magic dashboard

TO-DO: write this

## Postgres magic dashboard (deprecated)

As of version 3.x of the AppSignal for Node.js integration, the metrics used on the Postgres magic dashboard are no longer emitted, and therefore this magic dashboard is no longer created.
