# NGINX automated dashboard

[NGINX](https://nginx.org/) is a performant HTTP server and reverse proxy, commonly used as a first layer when handling traffic for web applications.

When using [the NGINX metrics integration](https://docs.appsignal.com/metrics/nginx.html#magic-dashboard), the NGINX automated dashboard will appear.

See the [NGINX automated dashboard documentation](https://docs.appsignal.com/metrics/nginx.html#magic-dashboard) and [metrics documentation](https://docs.appsignal.com/metrics/nginx.html#metrics) for details on the graphs displayed by this dashboard.
